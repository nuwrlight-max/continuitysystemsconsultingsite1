    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      Continuity Systems delivers concrete artifacts that reduce exposure, improve compliance posture,
      and hold up under scrutiny. This is not advisory theater—these are deliverables executives and teams
      use to make clear decisions quickly.
    </p>

    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:14px;">
      “We translate future regulatory reality into present-day executive decisions”.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Core Deliverables</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>Architecture Diagrams</b> — clear visual maps of systems and data flows, highlighting where risk lives, where controls belong, and how responsibilities should be separated.</li>
      <li><b>Executive Risk Memo</b> — a concise, leadership-ready brief outlining current exposure, priority risks, and recommended actions.</li>
      <li><b>90-Day Implementation Plan</b> — a practical sequence of steps your security, engineering, and compliance teams can execute without slowing delivery.</li>
      <li><b>Policy &amp; Governance Pack</b> — plain-English templates for access controls, logging, incident response, vendor risk, and audit readiness.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>How We Approach Risk</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>Compliance is becoming architectural</b> — posture increasingly depends on how systems are built, not just what policies say.</li>
      <li><b>Visibility without structure increases exposure</b> — unexamined data flows create unnecessary risk and confusion.</li>
      <li><b>Privacy-by-design is a control</b> — not a feature; it reduces attack surface and strengthens defensibility.</li>
      <li><b>Systems should withstand future scrutiny</b> — we design for where oversight is going, not only where it is today.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Scenarios We Prepare Teams For</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>Regulatory inquiries under compressed timelines</b> — fast clarity, clean documentation, defensible choices.</li>
      <li><b>Audit or diligence during fundraising / acquisition</b> — reduce friction and prevent “surprise gaps”.</li>
      <li><b>Data incidents requiring disciplined response</b> — structured containment, evidence, and reporting readiness.</li>
      <li><b>Vendor and partner risk escalation</b> — tighten access, logging, and responsibilities across boundaries.</li>
      <li><b>Shifts in regulatory interpretation</b> — adapt controls without destabilizing the operating model.</li>
    </ul>

      Request a risk clarity session—a short, structured conversation to determine whether an engagement makes sense.
